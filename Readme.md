### How to use:

1) Open ClickerHeroes and Launch this bot
2) Hover over the monster with your mouse
3) Press PageUP to start/stop the bot (it will start clicking where your mouse was)
4) PageDOWN does a single mouse click whenever you hover over the ClickerHeroes window (e.g. Steam Overlay)

**The bot can work IN BACKGROUND while the window is INACTIVE!** I.e. you can keep browsing interwebs and look at those cute kitten pics while farming in ClickerHeroes!

**Another cool feature:** the bot is VERY CPU-friendly. Kinda money back guarantee ;)

#### Configuration:

Self-explanatory in `clickerheroes.inf`

#### License:
