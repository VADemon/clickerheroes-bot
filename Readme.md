ClickerHeroes autoclicker bot. Fast, small and easy.

Download: [Releases Page](/VADemon/clickerheroes-bot/releases)

### How to use:

1) Open ClickerHeroes and Launch this bot
2) Hover over the monster with your mouse
3) Press PageUP to start/stop the bot (it will start clicking where your mouse was)
4) PageDOWN does a single mouse click whenever you hover over the ClickerHeroes window (e.g. Steam Overlay)

**The bot can work IN BACKGROUND while the window is INACTIVE!** I.e. you can keep browsing interwebs and look at those cute kitten pics while farming in ClickerHeroes!

**Another cool feature:** the bot is VERY CPU-friendly. Kinda money back guarantee ;)

#### Configuration:

Self-explanatory in `clickerheroes.inf`

#### Compilation:

You can compile it yourself, just get [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/) and double-click `ClickerHeroes.au3` to launch OR right-click to compile into `.exe`

Note: Of course a lot of "anti-virus" software will """detect""" it as a virus. The reason: they're all bad. Some malware was written using this language (AutoIt), so instead of only detecting the malware as good Anti-Virus should, they just tell you ALL of AutoIt programs are "viruses".

There's not much code, you can read all of it in 5 minutes.

#### License:

WTFPLv2 or whatever idc. Just make use of it, it's the greatest strength of the Internet.
